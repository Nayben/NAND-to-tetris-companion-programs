HDL Output Comparator 1.0
Made by Nayben

This is a simple program created in python that allows you to compare the output of your .OUT file with the provided
CMP file. If the files match, it will tell you, and if they do not match, it will tell you as well.

You can also view the contents of the files by pressing the view file description button.
CMP file is on the top, OUT file is on the bottom.

Thank you for using my program!
