HDL Output Comparator 1.0
Made by Nayben


This is a simple program created in python that allows you to compare the output of your .OUT file with the provided
CMP file. If the files match, it will tell you, and if they do not match, it will tell you as well, but in a wonderful red color.

You can also compare the contents of the files by pressing the Show File Details button.
CMP file is on the top, OUT file is on the bottom.

It also uses tkinter because the rest of NAND to Tetris is GUI based anyway.


Usage:
1. Place the Python program in the same directory as the CMP and OUT files that you want to test.
(If it is not in the same location, there will be errors because
it cannot find the files. In the future I will add a directory selection system so it can be placed anywhere)
2. Run the program!


Thank you for using my program!
